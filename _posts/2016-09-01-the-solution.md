* In Today's society, we have evolved from_**exchanging**__Business cards, _to exchanging _Social Media information_.
* As more _Social Media Platforms_ continue to emerge, social media is growing _exponentially_. It has become more of a task to keep up with peers on various applications; due to different user "Handles" per application.
* **For example: **Social Media users that have _Twitter & Instagram _(Both) don't always have the same _"User Handle"._
* Social Media has also made itself accessible to a**HIGH **amount of Fraudulent _"Spam"_ Accounts.
* **"Spam"** accounts are a false representation of the _verified_ User, you intended to search. (Sort of like "mirage" in the desert, while looking for water..)
* _TOMO! Mobile Application_ was developed as a **solution** to_exchange _social media information more_conveniently, efficiently._
* TOMO! has an _ultimate_ goal of ensuring that**Connections** between users on social media, would**NO** longer be a _difficult task._
* **TOMO! will also be utilized as a Tool** within _Small Business & Universities/Colleges_
* TOMO! will allow Users to **Link** their various Social Media Accounts on to **ONE** platform, to ensure a quick &**CONVENIENT **user experience _(While in the Application)_.
* TOMO! will also allow users to **share** their social media profile**like never before**, _Instantly!_
